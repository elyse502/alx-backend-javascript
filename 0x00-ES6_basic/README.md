# [0x00. ES6 Basics](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1224#task-11563)
# Concepts
_For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:_

* [Modern Javascript](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/541)
* [Software Linter](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/542)

# 2. Software Linter
## Definition
A software linter also known as a ‚Äúlinter‚Äù is a tool used to identify and report potential issues (syntax errors, undeclared variables, etc.) in a program. It can even report convention or style inconsistencies. It does so by highlighting them so that the programmer is aware, so changes can be made. There are a wide variety of linters as well as lint rules for specific programming languages and even for software frameworks.

There are typically two ways to lint code:
* Actively
* Passively

## Active
Active checking is typically achieved by running a monitor tool that is constantly checking the file that your working on in order to spot inconsistencies and possible errors (e.g., having a specific linter along with some lint rules installed as a plug-in in your Code Editor).

## Passive
Passive checking is done by taking a piece of code, and manually running it through a tool to identify potential issues. For example, copying and pasting your code into a specific linter tool, or running the linter against a specific file using the command line. This tool can be installed locally or be available as a service (e.g., website on the Internet).

### Examples

**Fun fact**: The term ‚Äúlint‚Äù was derived from the name of the tiny bits of fiber and fluff shed by clothing.

# Learning Objectives üìñ
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

* What ES6 is
* New features introduced in ES6
* The difference between a constant and a variable
* Block-scoped variables
* Arrow functions and function parameters default to them
* Rest and spread function parameters
* String templating in ES6
* Object creation and their properties in ES6
* Iterators and for-of loops

# Requirements üèõÔ∏è
## Generalüßµ
* All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the js extension
