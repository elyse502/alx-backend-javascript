# Learning Objectives üìñ
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

* How to use Mocha to write a test suite
* How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)
* How to present long test suites
* When and how to use spies
* When and how to use stubs
* What are hooks and when to use them
* Unit testing with Async functions
* How to write integration tests with a small node server

# Requirements üèõÔ∏è
* All of your code will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 using Node 12.x.x
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `js` extension
* When running every test with `npm run test *.test.js`, everything should pass correctly without any warning or error

# Tasks üìÉ
## 0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library: [package.json](package.json), [0-calcul.js](0-calcul.js), [0-calcul.test.js](0-calcul.test.js)
**Install Mocha using npm:**

* Set up a scripts in your `package.json` to quickly run Mocha using `npm test`
* You have to use `assert`

**Create a new file named `0-calcul.js`:**

* Create a function named `calculateNumber`. It should accepts two arguments (number) `a` and `b`
* The function should round `a` and `b` and return the sum of it

**Test cases**

* Create a file `0-calcul.test.js` that contains test cases of this function
* You can assume `a` and `b` are always number
* Tests should be around the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù part

**Tips:**

* For the sake of the example, this test suite is slightly extreme and probably not needed
* However, remember that your tests should not only verify what a function is supposed to do, but also the edge cases

**Requirements:**

* You have to use `assert`
* You should be able to run the test suite using `npm test 0-calcul.test.js`
* Every test should pass without any warning

**Expected output**
```groovy
> const calculateNumber = require("./0-calcul.js");
> calculateNumber(1, 3)
4
> calculateNumber(1, 3.7)
5
> calculateNumber(1.2, 3.7)
5
> calculateNumber(1.5, 3.7)
6
> 
```

**Run test**
```groovy
bob@dylan:~$ npm test 0-calcul.test.js 

> task_0@1.0.0 test /root
> ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha "0-calcul.test.js"

  calculateNumber
    ‚úì ...
    ‚úì ...
    ‚úì ...
    ...

  130 passing (35ms)
bob@dylan:~$
```

## 1. Combining descriptions: [1-calcul.js](1-calcul.js), [1-calcul.test.js](1-calcul.test.js)
**Create a new file named `1-calcul.js`:**

* Upgrade the function you created in the previous task (`0-calcul.js`)
* Add a new argument named `type` at first argument of the function. `type` can be `SUM`, `SUBTRACT`, or `DIVIDE` (string)
* When type is `SUM`, round the two numbers, and add `a` and `b`
* When type is `SUBTRACT`, round the two numbers, and subtract `b` from `a`
* When type is `DIVIDE`, round the two numbers, and divide `a` with `b` - if the rounded value of `b` is equal to 0, return the string `Error`

**Test cases**

* Create a file `1-calcul.test.js` that contains test cases of this function
* You can assume `a` and `b` are always number
* Usage of `describe` will help you to organize your test cases

**Tips:**

* For the sake of the example, this test suite is slightly extreme and probably not needed
* However, remember that your tests should not only verify what a function is supposed to do, but also the edge cases

**Requirements:**

* You have to use `assert`
* You should be able to run the test suite using `npm test 1-calcul.test.js`
* Every test should pass without any warning

**Expected output**
```groovy
> const calculateNumber = require("./1-calcul.js");
> calculateNumber('SUM', 1.4, 4.5)
6
> calculateNumber('SUBTRACT', 1.4, 4.5)
-4
> calculateNumber('DIVIDE', 1.4, 4.5)
0.2
> calculateNumber('DIVIDE', 1.4, 0)
'Error'
```

## 2. Basic test using Chai assertion library: [2-calcul_chai.js](2-calcul_chai.js), [2-calcul_chai.test.js](2-calcul_chai.test.js)
While using Node assert library is completely valid, a lot of developers prefer to have a behavior driven development style. This type being easier to read and therefore to maintain.

**Let‚Äôs install Chai with npm:**

* Copy the file `1-calcul.js` in a new file `2-calcul_chai.js` (same content, same behavior)
* Copy the file `1-calcul.test.js` in a new file `2-calcul_chai.test.js`
* Rewrite the test suite, using `expect` from `Chai`

**Tips:**

* Remember that test coverage is always difficult to maintain. Using an easier style for your tests will help you
* The easier your tests are to read and understand, the more other engineers will be able to fix them when they are modifying your code

**Requirements:**

* You should be able to run the test suite using `npm test 2-calcul_chai.test.js`
* Every test should pass without any warning

## 3. Spies: [utils.js](utils.js), [3-payment.js](3-payment.js), [3-payment.test.js](3-payment.test.js)
Spies are a useful wrapper that will execute the wrapped function, and log useful information (e.g. was it called, with what arguments). Sinon is a library allowing you to create spies.

**Let‚Äôs install Sinon with npm:**

* Create a new file named `utils.js`
* Create a new module named `Utils`
* Create a property named `calculateNumber` and paste your previous code in the function
* Export the Utils module

**Create a new file named `3-payment.js`:**

* Create a new function named `sendPaymentRequestToApi`. The function takes two argument `totalAmount`, and `totalShipping`
* The function calls the `Utils.calculateNumber` function with type `SUM`, `totalAmount` as `a`, `totalShipping` as `b` and display in the console the message `The total is: <result of the sum>`

**Create a new file named `3-payment.test.js` and add a new suite named `sendPaymentRequestToApi`:**

* By using `sinon.spy`, make sure the math used for `sendPaymentRequestToApi(100, 20)` is the same as `Utils.calculateNumber('SUM', 100, 20)` (validate the usage of the `Utils` function)

**Requirements:**

* You should be able to run the test suite using `npm test 3-payment.test.js`
* Every test should pass without any warning
* You should use a `spy` to complete this exercise

**Tips:**

* Remember to always restore a spy after using it in a test, it will prevent you from having weird behaviors
* Spies are really useful and allow you to focus only on what your code is doing and not the downstream APIs or functions
* Remember that integration test is different from unit test. Your unit test should test your code, not the code of a different function

## 4. Stubs: [4-payment.js](4-payment.js), [4-payment.test.js](4-payment.test.js)
Stubs are similar to spies. Except that you can provide a different implementation of the function you are wrapping. Sinon can be used as well for stubs.

**Create a new file `4-payment.js`, and copy the code from `3-payment.js`** (same content, same behavior)

**Create a new file `4-payment.test.js`, and copy the code from `3-payment.test.js`**

* Imagine that calling the function `Utils.calculateNumber` is actually calling an API or a very expensive method.
* You don‚Äôt necessarily want to do that on every test run
* Stub the function `Utils.calculateNumber` to always return the same number `10`
* Verify that the stub is being called with `type = SUM`, `a = 100`, and `b = 20`
* Add a spy to verify that console.log is logging the correct message `The total is: 10`

**Requirements:**

* You should be able to run the test suite using `npm test 4-payment.test.js`
* Every test should pass without any warning
* You should use a `stub` to complete this exercise
* Do not forget to restore the spy and the stub

**Tips:**

* Using stubs allows you to greatly speed up your test. When executing thousands of tests, saving a few seconds is important
* Using stubs allows you to control specific edge case (e.g a function throwing an error or returning a specific result like a number or a timestamp)

## 5. Hooks: [5-payment.js](5-payment.js), [5-payment.test.js](5-payment.test.js)
Hooks are useful functions that can be called before execute one or all tests in a suite

**Copy the code from `4-payment.js` into a new file `5-payment.js`:** (same content/same behavior)

**Create a new file `5-payment.test.js`:**

* Inside the same `describe`, create 2 tests:
  * The first test will call `sendPaymentRequestToAPI` with 100, and 20:
    * Verify that the console is logging the string `The total is: 120`
    * Verify that the console is only called once
  * The second test will call `sendPaymentRequestToAPI` with 10, and 10:
    * Verify that the console is logging the string `The total is: 20`
    * Verify that the console is only called once

**Requirements:**

* You should be able to run the test suite using `npm test 5-payment.test.js`
* Every test should pass without any warning
* You should use only one `spy` to complete this exercise
* You should use a `beforeEach` and a `afterEach` hooks to complete this exercise
